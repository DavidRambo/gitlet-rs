* gitlet-rs
  A simple git-like version control CLI written in Rust and inspired by UC Berkeley's Gitlet project (an assignment in a course that uses Java).
  I'm writing this for my own edification, as it is a nice project for TTD of a CLI app.

** Related projects
   After doing it in Java, I implemented it [in Python](https://github.com/DavidRambo/gitlepy).

  - [X] cli arg parser

  - [X] restore
  - [X] status: additions and removals
  - [ ] `stage` should write blob so that further modifications are separate
  - [ ] status: staged file with later changes
  - [ ] commit
  - [ ] remove blobs that have been unstaged and restaged if they are not part of a prior commit (this will likely require dedicating a separate subdir for staged blobs)
  - [ ] log
  - [ ] branch
  - [X] status: current branch
  - [ ] switch [-c]
  - [ ] merge
  - [ ] add headers to gitlet objects (as in git)
