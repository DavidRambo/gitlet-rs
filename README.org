* gitlet-rs
  A simple git-like version control CLI written in Rust and inspired by UC Berkeley's Gitlet project (an assignment in a course that uses Java).
  I'm writing this for my own edification, as it is a nice project for TTD of a CLI app.

   After doing it in Java, I implemented it [in Python](https://github.com/DavidRambo/gitlepy).
